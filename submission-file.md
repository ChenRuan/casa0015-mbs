## Introduction to Application

EzTour, an innovative travel planning app, is the perfect companion for explorers around the world. The app is designed to make the travel experience easier for all the travellers. It gives the user an opportunity to plan and create his own itinerary in an easy way. It allows all the users to add the to do list, attractions, and transportation they prefer in their own journey.
